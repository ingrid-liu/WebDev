      <p>As a family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver">caregiver</a>,
        you have a lot on your plates — both proverbial and literal.
        You know your loved one needs high-quality daily meals that balance fiber, healthy fats,
        carbohydrates, protein, calories and the harder-to-assess invisible ingredients,
        vitamins and minerals. But how much is enough? Wondering if you’re hitting the nutritional mark can stress the chef.</p>

      <p class="p2">A good question. Most of us get all the nutrients we need from a healthy diet,
        but after age 50 the wiggle room of youth begins to shrink and the ability to absorb vitamins
         from food slowly diminishes. Vitamin and mineral shortages can have serious consequences.</p>

      <p>The best prevention is to learn to spot the signs of malnutrition in aging people and
         serve meals that are nutrient-dense, packed with vitamins, fiber, complex carbohydrates and
          protein —  much of it plant-based.</p>
